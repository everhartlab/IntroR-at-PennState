title: "Before The Workshop"
---


Again, because this is a four hour workshop, we ask that you come prepared with
a laptop that has the most recent versions of [R] and [RStudio] installed, and
our [workshop materials] downloaded to your Desktop. **We cannot provide service
for installation the day of the workshop. Those who are not prepared for the 
workshop may be asked to give up their seat to those on the waitlist**.

Installation
------------

Even if you already have [R] installed on your system, you really should make
sure its up to date. This ensures that there are no problems due to outdated
software. For more details about installing [R], [RStudio], and keeping
everything up to date, UBC's [STAT545] page is an excellent resource.

 - [R]
 - [RStudio]
 - [Workshop Materials] (zip file; unzip to Desktop)
 - (Once you've installed R) packages "[dplyr]" and "[ggplot2]"

Verification
------------

Once you have installed [R], we should verify that you have the correct version.

 1. Open R (or RStudio) on your computer
 2. Enter the following in the R console after the `>`    
        
        R.version.string == "R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02)"
        
 3. Make sure the result is **`[1] TRUE`**    
    (If the result is `[1] FALSE`, please quit R and try the installation again)
 
 
Workshop Materials
------------------

Our [workshop materials] is a zip file that contains a folder called 
`IntroR-master/` with the folowing structure:

```
.
├── IntroR_Workshop.Rproj
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile
├── Part1-Introduction.R
├── Part2-Analysis.R
├── Part3-Visualization.R
├── README.md
├── data/
│   ├── fungicide_dat.csv
│   └── README.md
└── docs/
    └── ...
```

We are providing the R scripts for the workshop, so that you can easily 
execute the code in these scripts to follow along.

Installing Packages
-------------------

To install [dplyr] and [ggplot2] to your system, open R and type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"), repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
```
